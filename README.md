# Build the Leviathan (Power Transfer Game) in Japan

## about the Project

This is an otree project for the public goods game with punishment. There are three treatments in this experiment: 

1.fixed: Participants' power to punish is fixed. 

2.transfer_free: Participants can transfer their power to punish to others at no cost.

3.transfer_cost: Participants must pay a cost to transfer their power to punish to others.


## How to Run the Project

1. Clone the repository to the PC which you choose as the server.

2. Start the project from the command line:

```    
otree devserver 0.0.0.0:8000
```

3. Access the experiment by links:

    - Make sure the participant's device is connected to the same local network (LAN) as the server.


## How to Test the Project Automaticly

Test the project from the command linesï¼š

``` 
otree test pggp_fixed
```

``` 
otree test pggp_transfer_free
```

```
otree test pggp_transfer_cost
```
These command lines can only submit fixed values (contribution, punishment and power transfer). After modifying the code, use these command lines to test whether the experimental process can be completed smoothly.
